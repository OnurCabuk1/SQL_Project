# SQL Project Documentation

## About the Project
This project contains SQL analyses and results performed on a dataset. The main objective of the project is to conduct analyses using SQL queries based on the given cases and to report the results of these analyses.

## Project Steps

### 1. ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
Before starting the project, I created an ERD diagram to understand the relationships between the tables in the dataset. This diagram visually represented the database structure and guided the analyses.

### 2. Analysis and Case Solutions
I wrote detailed SQL queries based on the given cases. Each analysis was reported as follows:
- The SQL queries I wrote were added to a **Word document**.
- Based on the outputs of the queries:
  - I included **screenshots of the usable table outputs** from the SQL tables.
  - I prepared **graphs in Excel** to visualize the data better and included screenshots.

## Content
- **ERD Diagram**: A visual representation of the relationships between the tables.
- **SQL Queries and Outputs**: All SQL queries and the results of the analyses.
- **Excel Visualizations**: Graphical representations of the analysis results in Excel.

## Files
- **`sql_project_documentation.docx`**: A Word document containing all analyses and screenshots of the outputs of the project.

## Usage
1. You can download the project Word file (`sql_project_documentation.docx`) to review the analyses and results.
2. You can run the SQL queries in your own database to observe the results.

## Note
This project is prepared on SQL data analysis and the visualization of results. Please feel free to contact me for any suggestions or feedback!
